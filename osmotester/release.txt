maven central: mvn clean deploy

locally: mvn install

~/.m2/settings.xml needs to have sonatype login details

mvnrepository.com is apparently not always in sync with maven central, just shows info about it:
https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/net.kanstren.osmo/osmotester

check here if upload is synced to maven central:
https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/net/kanstren/
