/**
 * A test generation algorithm that is similar to the {@link BalancingAlgorithm} but also takes into account
 * weights assigned to test steps. This algorithm does not consider step-pairs, it only balances the steps according
 * to their frequency in the trace so far and the weight they have been given.
 * <p>
 * For example, consider a model that has 2 steps A and B, and both have been visited twice.
 * Now if A has a weight of 2 and B a weight of 3, the algorithm favors B due to its combined weight and coverage values.
 * <p>
 * The formula is:
 * -for each possible choice calculate: test step weight / number of times step covered
 * -multiply these values until you get a value over 10
 * -use the resulting values as the "score" to pick one of the test steps (as weighted random choice, score=weight)
 * <p>
 * Thus steps with same coverage and same weight = same probability to be taken next.
 * Steps with same coverage but different weight = one with higher weight has higher probability to be taken next.
 * Steps with different coverage and different weight = which one gets higher score depends on how much bigger is
 * the weight and how much bigger is the coverage on either of the choices.
 * <p>
 * Note than in calculation, a step that is never visited has a visited value of 1 (and one that is visited once
 * has a value of 2 and so on) to allow for simplified calculation of test step scores. Otherwise all
 * test steps would start with score of 0, and the choices of first step would be random without weight.
