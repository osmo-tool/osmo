# About

This sub-project contains a few simple visualization helpers to view OSMO models.
NOTE: this component is currently not maintained. Most of the visualizer code would need updates to work properly.

Requires the OSMO Tester accessible for use.
If the latest changes are not on Maven Central, 
the simplest way is to run

```bash
cd osmotester
mvn clean install
```

After which this should build with Maven as:

```bash
cd examples
mvn clean compile
```
